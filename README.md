# README

This is *another* todo application

But this is done using pure old ruby on rails HTML in the wire code and it is compared, as a way of practicing, to a pure ReactJS front end

* System dependencies

See Gemfile and Yarn.lock

* Database creation and Initialization

Run in console a db:setup

* How to run the test suite

TBD

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

None for now

* Deployment instructions

Using DigitalOcean simple deploy procedure, just for fun: https://todoisnt-2ql5k.ondigitalocean.app/

Just a simple Push to the master is enough to deploy :)
